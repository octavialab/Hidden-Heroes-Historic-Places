"About Hidden Heroes, Historic Places",,,,"The Octavia Lab has put together a storymap of the Hidden Heroes, Historic Places coloring page series. We hope that our work in highlighting less-than-well-know people and historical locations in the Los Angeles will give people a deeper understanding of how social activism and communities thrive when we work together. We have organized our subjects chronologically, as to give an arc of how things have gradually changed in our communities. 
This storymap is a work in progress and we hope that you enjoy this work.

Ballard was born in Kentucky as an enslaved person before being freed and relocating to Los Angeles in 1859. In California, Ballard became a prominent member of Los Angeles’s African American community, helping to found the city’s first African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. In 2010, the name of the mountain where Ballard settled was renamed Ballard Mountain, in his honor. John Ballard is pictured here with his descendants in front of the mountain that bears his name.

Some noteworthy descendants of John Ballard include: 

Dr. Claudius Ballard. Grandson of John Ballard. Attended UC Berkeley medical school in 1913. Served in World War I as a first lieutenant in the US Army Medical Reserve Corps. Awarded the French Croix de Guerre medal for bravery.

Reginald Ballard. Great-grandson of John Ballard, Son of Dr. Claudius Ballard. During World War II, trained with the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the first African American flying unit in the United States military. Later served as a Los Angeles firefighter and challenged the department’s segregation policies.

Ballard Mountain,,,,"In a stark reminder of racial attitudes, the name given to the area in the Santa Monica Mountains where John Ballard and his family lived was a racial slur; in fact, it was officially listed in county records and the US Geological Survey as N**head. In the 1960s, the name was changed to Negrohead. In 2010, after a two-year campaign, it became officially known as Ballard Mountain.

Ballard Mountain is a 2,031-foot volcanic peak located just outside the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, about six miles north of Malibu. Ballard’s homestead property included a 16-by-16-foot cabin and a separate kitchen of equal size. Ballard also had a barn, chicken house, drinking well, and fences. After the Woolsey fire burned the area in November 2018, researchers were able to find artifacts from the approximate time period that Ballard lived there. ",17,Hidden,blue,,,,,,,

The Liberator fearlessly advocated for improved social and economic conditions for the Black Angeleno community at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1912, Los Angeles City Attorney, John Shenk tacitly reinforced segregation in Los Angeles by stating that it was not extortion to charge different prices for people who were African American or white. Edmonds attacked the decision in print and used the pages of The Liberator to chronicle discrimination and hardship caused by the Shenk Rule. When John Shenk ran for mayor in 1913, Jefferson L. Edmonds, using The Liberator as his platform, urged African Americans to vote against Shenk. Shenk was ultimately defeated by a small margin.

From 1872 to 1889, it was housed on the second floor of Downey Block, a large commercial building in Downtown Los Angeles that once stood on N. Main Street between W. Aliso and W. Temple Streets. Owned by Governor John G. Downey (1827–1894), it was one of the leading addresses for professionals in early Los Angeles. Between 1850 and 1870, Native American slave auctions were held there—an activity that was legal in California at the time. The California Act for the Government and Protection of Indians of 1850 allowed any white person to post bail for a convicted Native person and then require him or her to work for the white man until the fine was discharged. The Downey Block was torn down in 1905 and is now the location of a federal courthouse. ",17,Hidden,blue,,,,,,,

At the turn of the century, the area was a red-light district notorious for its rough nightlife. A Pacific Electric Railway trolley stop made it easy for rowdy party-goers and thrill seekers to find their way to Sycamore Grove. Former city librarian Charles Lummis added to the area’s notoriety by throwing saloon-style parties at his nearby home, El Alisal. In 1905, the City of Los Angeles purchased the land and established one of its first municipal parks, eventually transforming Sycamore Grove into a popular family-friendly recreational spot with a bandshell and well-maintained lawns. Sycamore Grove Park frequently hosted annual State Picnics and other community events. The park still has its namesake sycamore trees and now includes children’s play areas, tennis courts, outdoor gym equipment, and the historic Sousa-Hiner Bandshell.

Los Angeles River,,,,"The Los Angeles River flows through 33 cities in Los Angeles County. It starts in the Santa Susana Mountains and travels its 51-mile path through the San Fernando Valley, Downtown Los Angeles, and out into the Pacific Ocean in Long Beach. Prior to the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, the river supplied fresh water to Los Angeles residents. Rainfall in Los Angeles varies from year to year; some years, there are only four inches of rain for the entire year, on average 15, and during years of torrential rainfall, it is possible to get 26 inches in 24 hours. Therefore, residents who lived close to the river during early Los Angeles, dealt with frequent flooding during the winter rainy season. After a series of devastating floods in the 1930s, the Army Corp of Engineers ripped out the entire river and created a concrete channel that fixed the path of the river and served as flood control. Unfortunately, as a growing city, the water flowing through the concrete channel became heavily polluted from agricultural and urban runoff. Starting in 1986, through the activism of FoLAR, watershed management policies have evolved from being solely focused on flood mitigation. Through community activism from FoLAR and others, federal, state and local legislation has revitalized the river to become a part of the Los Angeles ecosystem into drawing in native habitat, continue to protect the neighboring residential areas from devastating floods, improve river water quality, and create much needed recreational areas.
